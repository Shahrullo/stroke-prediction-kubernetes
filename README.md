# Deploying Machine Learning Models on Google Cloud Platform: From Development to Production with Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes
### A beginner-friendly guide to train and deploy a stroke prediction machine learning model on Google Kubernetes Engine



## Objective
Develop and deploy a machine learning model for predicting strokes. This model will be trained on relevant medical data to accurately identify individuals who might be at risk of experiencing a stroke. The goal is to create a robust and accurate prediction tool that can assist medical professionals in assessing stroke risk factors and making informed decisions about patient care. The deployed model should be integrated into existing healthcare systems to provide timely insights and support preventive measures, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes and healthcare management.
